  'content': 'Purnendu Pritam With heavy rains, thunderstorms and sandstorms, nature has wreaked havoc in multiple parts of the country throwing normal life off gear in many states. Three people were reported dead and eight were trapped in a landslide due to heavy rainfall in Kozhikode\'s Kattipara. Another 9-year old girl was reported dead and 10 people are suspected to be missing due to heavy rains in Kozhikode and Kannur. More than 270 houses were reportedly damaged across Kerala. 10 people were also reported dead in UP with over 28 being injured after thunderstorm lashed parts of Gonda, Faizabad and Sitapur in Uttar Pradesh. Over 14 deaths were reported across the North eastern states with incessant rains leading to floods in Tripura, Mizoram and Assam. The swollen Khawthlangtuipui river has submerged over 350 houses in in Mizoram’s Lunglei. Over 2,000 families were reportedly affected by the floods. Meanwhile, air quality in certain areas of Delhi NCR reached “poor” and “hazardous” levels on Thursday due to dust storms from Rajasthan. Air quality in the national capital deteriorated beyond "severe" level earlier on Wednesday. The Environment Ministry predicted that the dusty conditions will continue for the next two-three days. The Madras High Court on Thursday delivered a split verdict on the petitions challenging the disqualification of 18 AIADMK MLAs loyal to sidelined leader TTV Dhinakaran. While High Court Chief Justice Indira Banerjee upheld the Speaker\'s order disqualifying the MLAs, Justice M Sundar struck it down on the ground on that it violates the principles of natural justice and therefore should be subjected to judicial review. According to  , the matter will now be referred to a third judge, who will be selected by the second-most senior judge in the court, namely Justice Huluvadi G Ramesh.

  'content': "Ahead of the Rajasthan assembly elections on 7 December, the Congress party’s state President Sachin Pilot, spoke to  . In a scathing critique, Pilot said of the incumbent Rajasthan government: It is believed that there is a strong sense of anti-incumbency on ground. So is it Modi who will have to step in to salvage Raje’s government? Pilot goes on to say, “So, today if Modi and Amit Shah go and campaign for the BJP in Rajasthan, they have to account for the last 4 and a half years of Vasundhara ji’s government. So it’s not easy to cover-up the misdeeds of Raje’s government and then ask for 5 more years. People have to know where the performance was.” From the large turnout, it seems that Vasundhara Raje’s ‘Gaurav Yatra’ was a success. What are your thoughts on this? This yatra that she is doing now is basically a face-saving exercise. As I keep saying, as opposed to ‘Gaurav Yatra’, Raje should have taken out a ‘Pashchatap Yatra’. She must atone for the sins she has committed as chief minister in the last 4 and a half years. And now Vasundhara ji, to counter the Congress’s work, is taking out this Gaurav Yatra, which is on government expense. It’s illegal, it’s immoral to use taxpayers’ money to do a political yatra. BJP is a rich party. Why is Vasundhara Raje not using the BJP’s money to organise meetings? “Today, the Rajasthan government is paying for the tent, loudspeakers, for ferrying people, for all the expenses of the party meetings, which Amit Shah had launched. So I think they are misusing the taxpayers' money, and that too for political purposes. People are watching all this very carefully. And the people who are coming out to listen to Raje are not going to vote for her. They were brought there because the government machinery was fully deployed,” continued Sachin Pilot. Is the Congress’s counter-narrative to Raje’s aggressive campaigns strong enough? There was no BJP president for 2 and a half months in Rajasthan. At that time, we (Congress party) went to the rural parts of Rajasthan, and out of 200 constituencies, we had ‘mera booth, mera gaurav’ programmes in 196. 50,000 booths, booth workers identifying them, linking them to the ‘Shakti’ project, and really, giving them political tasks. That was done at the grassroots and the booth-level. That’s what we did in the summer. Pilot added, “We (Congress) are doing ‘Sankalp’ rallies across Rajasthan. Rahul Gandhi came on 11 August and did a massive roadshow in Jaipur. We have a rally on 28 August and on 5, 10 and 12 September. So our campaign is fully on the ground.” Is the Congress likely to fall into the trap of complacency in Rajasthan? We are getting tremendous traction and without sounding immodest, I want to say that, I believe that the feedback we’ve gotten so far, the reactions, the attendance people have marked; young people in urban areas, rural areas are coming in hordes to show their faith in the Congress. So it’s a very positive indication, and I’m very confident that in December, when the elections happen, we’ll be able to secure a historic mandate. Why should Rajasthan vote for the Congress? 150 farmers have committed suicide. For the first time in Rajasthan, so many farmers are killing themselves. And here, Raje is taking out Gaurav Yatras when women are getting raped, farmers are committing suicide, young people are jobless. So this sort of situation is untenable. People want a change, and they want a positive change. And that’s where I think the Congress party’s role is very, very crucial. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

  'content': "Mohd Irshad Alam Not only did Manvendra Singh quit the BJP and join the Congress party ahead of the Rajasthan Assembly elections, but is now also contesting against sitting BJP Chief Minister Vasudhara Raje.  met him in Rajasthan’s Jhalawar district, where he stands from Jhalrapatan constituency, a seat that Raje has won for three consecutive terms. He is the son of Jaswant Singh, a tall Rajpur leader who, despite being one of the founding members of the Bharatiya Janata Party, was denied a ticket to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. This battle for Manvendra is a personal one that he did not want to fight in the first place. Vasundhara Raje has been winning from this seat for three consecutive terms, and the margin she is winning by has also steadily increased from 27,000 in 2003 to 61,000 votes in 2013. What do you think will work in your favour? I think every election is a different situation. Particularly in 2018, where the politics of Rajasthan has taken a huge turn. There is an underswell against a particular kind of governance, which is palpable under the surface across the state. Coming here, I feel the underswell is also covered with a huge campaign against tyranny. All polls have predicted a Congress win in the state, sir. You are Jaswant Singh’s son, you have won before, you are politically relevant in Mewar. So, would it have been better for you to stand from Barmer as opposed to here, where you are contesting against somebody who has\xa0 a political legacy here for 30-35 years, and has been an MLA here for three consecutive terms? Certainly it would have been better to stand from the Barmer-Jodhpur side, but that is if I wanted to contest and I did not want to contest. So that question is not so connected to me because it is a question for the will to win, I mean, the will to contest, which I didn’t have. An offer like this, as the quote says from   the movie, “Make an offer I cannot refuse.” So yeah, they made an offer I couldn’t refuse. All polls say the Congress will win. You could have stood from a lot of other seats where anti-incumbency is strong, where leaders are not so strong, but they put you here, where there is a good chance that you might lose. Sure, I am realistic about it. I am not being romantic about the results. I am realistic about the situation. But don’t you think there could have been an easier gateway to being an MLA if it was from a different place? If they really truly wanted you to be representative... I don’t think you should find a conspiracy. There is a conspiracy in the question. There is no conspiracy in my nomination from here. In case you lose, is there something they (the Congress) have promised they’ll give you despite that? I am not in a situation... My fondness for Rahul Gandhi does not permit me to have a bargaining power. Why are you fond of him, sir? We became MPs together and we continued to be in touch. I’ve seen him grow as he has a (sense of) responsibility, which most of us do not have. I have seen him grow into responsibility. People generally tend to vote for a probable CM candidate from a constituency  , they automatically come on the map. Do you think that might work against you as well? It may. It may also work to my advantage. Sir, it sounds like... Do you think you might lose?  I hope not. It could also work to my advantage. This is an uphill task for you, when Jaswant Singh sir was not given the ticket for the 2014 LS polls, it wasn’t good for the Rajputs of Mewar, to say one thing. Do you think if you lose this, you will be able to survive the political game? I’m sure I will. The goodwill is flowing enormously from everywhere across spectrum of communities. Your wife has accompanied you on the campaign trail, does she like it? Do you have fights about it later in the evening? No, we do not have fights like that, but like all women, she does not like surprises. Surprise gifts are okay, but you can’t be surprised with an election campaign like this. So she was not happy being surprised like that. What was the surprising factor? The fact that we didn’t ask for a ticket, I mean, nobody wanted. People wanted someone to contest from the family, but I was not keen on contesting. You were expecting her – your wife, Chitra Singh – of contesting from here. Why do you think she is a good fit for the region? A, because her village is not very far from here, in that sense, she is a geographical neighbour and a cultural neighbour in an immediate sense. And more than anything else, because she is a woman, she has an extra allowance, which I don’t have. If you lose, sir, would you be upset with the Congress for making you stand from here? No, not at all. This should not be seen as a conspiracy, but as a gesture which has great significance. Rajasthan votes on 7 December and the results will be out on 11 December.

  'content': "Ashutosh Bharadwaj Smitha TK The race to win the Telangana throne is getting more thrilling as election day approaches. As ruling Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) is busy promising welfare schemes to farmers, he has competition brewing in the opposition camp. Congress leader Uttam Kumar Reddy has filed his nomination in his home ground, the Huzurnagar constituency, and many say he could be the chief ministerial candidate floated by the grand alliance. The rally saw hundreds of people dancing, flags waving, loud sloganeering and   (folk dance). caught up with the Congress leader to find out how he plans to defeat the KCR government this time. In a candid conversation, Reddy said that he hopes their party doesn’t repeat any of these mistakes. “This time, we have been far more careful and hopefully those mistakes won't be repeated. I am fairly sure that the people's front we have formed now – Congress-TDP-CPM-TJS – we will win the elections with an overwhelming majority,” said Reddy. He criticised the ruling government for failing farmers, youth and women. “He promised something and didn’t do it. He looted the state. He has been an oppressive dictator, trying to suppress people's rights. I think he has been exposed now,” he added. He alleged that the chief minister’s move to dissolve the Telangana Assembly was a conspiracy. On 6 September 2018, KCR recommended the dissolution of the Assembly and called for early elections. He had said that he was doing it in the interests of the state, and that he wanted to curb the state’s political fragility. However, Reddy said he suspects the early election has been a result of a conspiracy between PM Narendra Modi, the Election Commission, and KCR. He said there was no other explanation for how the schedule announced by KCR was exactly the same as what was announced by the Election Commission. Reddy was a former fighter pilot and served as the Comptroller of Security, Protocol, Administration, Foreign Trips of the President at Rashtrapathi Bhavan. He is a four-time MLA and a former minister of Housing. Reddy said his agenda, if elected to power, would be to introduce farm loan waivers, unemployment toll, financial incentives to women’s self-help groups, and remunerative prices for farmers to purchase crops. If Congress wins, Reddy could become the chief minister – but when asked, he chooses to leave it to Rahul Gandhi. “I have no such ambitions. My limited role is to lead the Congress party this election. And I think I will do that successfully. The next step is in the hands of Rahul Gandhi,” he said.

  'content': 'Days after Punjab Cabinet Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu said it was Rahul Gandhi who sent him to Pakistan, and that he was his “captain” and “the captain of the Captain (Amrinder Singh),” speaking to the media in Rajasthan, Sidhu clarified that he will sort out the issue with Amarinder Singh himself. Navjot Singh Sidhu had also clarified on Friday, 30 November, that he didn\'t go there on the instructions of his party Chief Rahul Gandhi. “The whole world knows I went on PM Imran Khan’s personal invite,” he wrote on Twitter: Earlier, on Sunday, 2 December, his wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu had clarified that he did not mean any disrespect to Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh. According to ANI, Navjot Kaur Sidhu also asserted that her husband’s statement “should be read as a whole and not in incomplete bits.” In the day, Sidhu had triggered the controversy when he said that Gandhi had sent him to Pakistan for attending the inauguration ceremony of the Kartarpur corridor and that the Congress president was his "captain.” On Friday, to a query at a news conference, Sidhu had said, "Rahul Gandhi is my captain. It is he who sent me to Pakistan. Rahul Gandhi is the also the captain of the Captain (Amarinder)," Sidhu told a press conference in Hyderabad when asked about Singh\'s disapproval of his Pakistan trip. Sidhu said 50-100 Congress leaders, including Shashi Tharoor, Harish Rawat and Randeep Surjewala "patted" him on his back for the visit. Replying to a question about Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi\'s remark that Prime Minister Imran Khan\'s "googly" had compelled India to send two Union ministers for the Kartarpur event, Sidhu said, "How do you bowl a googly to a batsman. I have never left such a ball." "When 10,000 people are taking selfies with you, how do you know who is Chawla? How? This is absolute rubbish. The last time when I went to Pakistan, I was sitting with someone who was again controversial,” Sidhu said. "Am I supposed to see where I sit. When you are going to another country, you are looked after by them. Anybody who comes to me... I don\'t break hearts... come here and take a photograph," he said, adding that the man identified as Chawla was seen "everywhere" during the trip, including with Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal. "I have won six elections here. Only a popular person can win six elections. Ask Smriti Irani (Union minister) how many elections has she won," he said. Punjab Cabinet Minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa sought Sidhu\'s resignation over his jibe at Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, news agency PTI  . According to  , Punjab Cabinet ministers Rana Gurminder Singh Sodhi and Sukbinder Singh Sarkaria have joined Bajwa in demanding Sidhu’s resignation, while Gurjit Singh Aujl, the party’s Amrtisar MP, took to openly criticising Sidhu. Punjab’s minister of forest expressed his sadness over Sidhu’s remarks, reported ANI. He also asserted that “this is not Kapil Sharma’s show,” and Sidhu should show respect. He said: Women and Child Development and Transport Minister Aruna Chaudhary said, "What Navjot Singh Sidhu said about Capt Amarinder Singh is unfortunate. Such things should not have been said by him.” She added: BJP National Secretary Tarun Chugh alleged that Sidhu is a man of U-turns and should be sacked immediately. He said: While Union Minister Vijay Tampa said Sidhu has “lost mental balance,” Revenue and Rehabilitation Minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria and Sports Minister Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi called for Sidhu\'s resignation from the state Cabinet.

  'content': 'BJP State President, P Sreedharan Pillai on Friday, 30 November, said that the party will strengthen its stand on the Sabarimala issue by beginning a protest outside the Kerala Secretariat in Thiruvananthapuram from Monday onwards. The protest, which will go on for two weeks will see party members from each of the 14 districts coming to the Secretariat to protest each day. Some of the demands that BJP will be putting forth during the protest will include lifting of restrictions in Sabarimala and strict action against the police officers for allegedly foisting false case on K Surendran, the general secretary of the party. The BJP state president said that the decision to shift the protest from Sabarimala to the Secretariat comes after women between ages 10 and 50 have stopped attempting to enter the shrine. “Only if women between these ages try to enter the temple, will we begin protesting at Sabarimala again. Now that some of the restrictions are lifted, we will receive backlash from the devotees (if protests inconvenience them),” said Sreedharan Pillai. Reacting to this, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that he welcomes the BJP’s decision to shift their protests to the Secretariat. “This decision by the BJP shows they have understood that the people have started to grasp the stand of the state government regarding the Sabarimala issue,” said Pinarayi Vijayan. “It is not possible to stand straight if you take a stand that is not acceptable by the society,” said the CM. Pinarayi Vijayan also stated that the cases filed against the BJP leaders were not because of the stand taken by the state government. “All of this is a part of implementing the law. There is no point of protesting demanding the withdrawal of the case,” said Pinarayi Vijayan, who went on to add that his office has nothing to do with the cases on K Surendran. “There is nothing wrong in conducting protest in front of the Secretariat, but the BJP should introspect if the demands raised can be accepted," the CM said.

  'content': "There’s an agrarian crisis gripping our country and pushing the hands that feed us to commit suicide, says senior journalist P Sainath. There has never been an urgent need to address this crisis more than now, and the hundreds of country’s farmers want the parliamentarians to listen, he points out. Sainath, a renowned journalist known for his ground reports that focus on the plight of the farmers, has been participating in protest marches organised by the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC). “The message behind this march is that people expect Parliament to work for the people and not just for the corporate world. When a special session of Parliament can be called for the rollout of GST, with virtually no notice, then why can’t one be called for the farmers’ issues,” he asks. He says that the first Swaminathan commission report was submitted in 2004 – and the last in 2006 – which means that “in 14 years, Parliament has not found the time to discuss the report.” We also need to discuss the water crisis in the country, which is not just limited to droughts, he added. “Senseless utilisation of resources is taking place. There are massive transfers of water from agriculture to industry, from village to the city, from food crop to cash crop, etc,” Sainath says. Sainath says that there is also a need to engage with, and uphold the rights and needs of those who do the greatest amount of work in agriculture: The women farmers – both landed and landless. He said that another major differentiation of this protest was how seriously “the middle class is now taking the issues of farmers, after almost 20 years of indifference.” “Be it Mumbai, Nashik or Delhi... doctors, teachers, and students from universities all over the country have come out in support of the farmers,” he says. Sainath has been mobilising support for the farmers' march to Delhi, which has been organised in collaboration with over 200 farmers’ outfits. Hundreds of farmers from different locations marched to Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan on Thursday, 29 November. On Friday, 30 November, the farmers will walk from Ramlila Maidan to the Parliament Street to demand a Joint Session of Parliament to discuss the agrarian crisis.

  'content': "The pristine Andaman and Nicobar islands lie in splendid isolation over 750 kms in the Bay of Bengal, and have a chequered history. After lying unclaimed for centuries, they were colonized by the British for over 150 years and briefly by the Japanese during World War II. They are intricately linked with the forests they live in and have limited, or in some cases, no contact at all with the outside world. Most of them live as hunter-gatherers and prefer to remain in seclusion. Between 2013 and 2016, I faced many challenges living here, as administrator of the islands. Having toured the islands extensively, and interacted with all shades of opinion, I came to the conclusion that there are 4 centres of gravity in these islands viz strategic security; the settlers and their development aspirations; the indigenous tribes and their right to live in the manner they wish to in the protected space reserved for them; and of course, the pristine environment. These 4 centres of gravity have to live in harmony, and not at the expense of each other. This articulation became necessary ad helpful to place the narrative in a balanced perspective. There are strong views on both ends of the spectrum: one view is that we should leave the tribals alone, backed by strong evidence that any contact with modernisation has been deterimental to the primitive tribes. At the other end of the spectrum, there is an equally strong view to mainstream the tribals – why deny them the fruits of modernisation, they ask. We were surprised: the Jarawas wanted selective interaction. There are over 400 Jarawas living in the Jarawa tribal reserve, measuring 1000 sq kms, in south and middle Andaman Islands. The tribe was once feared for their hostility, but over the years have become less so. The Andaman Trunk Road, a national highway that cuts through the tribal reserve , has given rise to allegations of ‘tribal tourism’ by many NGOs who even went to the extent of calling for a tourism boycott of the islands. This accusation was not entirely true, though there have been sporadic cases, including unlawful acts committed by the settlers who live in the vicinity of the reserved areas. As per a Supreme Court directive, an alternate sea route has also become functional. Violations of the primitive tribe regulations ANPATR-1956 are viewed very seriously, though convictions in the courts have been tardy. In our endeavour to interact with them, seven-eight hotspots were designated for interactions to take place. Women would get their children on designated days, and a bilingual script based on their own ‘Ongan’ language was taught. A very rudimentary barter system was also initiated to preserve their dignity. To our surprise, the women requested for clothes; basic clothing was provided, which the women wore only when crossing the road. We also set up an “Andaman Nicobar Tribal Research Institute – ANTRI” in 2014, where research and study programmes provide valuable data for creating informed policies. In fact, some of the Nicobar elders were very enthused, as they believed that their heritage, culture, customs, language and traditions needed to be preserved for future generations. Untill 1993, the administration tried to befriend the Sentinelese, but their efforts were in vain. With effect from 1993, the approved policy was changed to “hands off” to respect the will of the Sentinelese. This meant that we could undertake periodical helicopter reconnaissances, and also circumnavigation by sea. A number of poachers were apprehended near the island, vindicating our change of policy. While a case of murder may have been registered against unknown people, the law will be difficult to apply against people who do not understand it, live in a different world, and who only acted to defend themselves against illegal intrusion. A similar dilemma occurred with respect to the Jarawas. Once a report came in that Jarawa men had killed a 5-month-old-child whom they suspected of being born of illicit relations between a settler and a Jarawa woman. While the settler was arrested, we did not have clarity with reference to the Jarawa, who were actually very open about it. Such cases have to be dealt with very sensitively, keeping in view the fact that the isolated tribes do not understand the law and live by their own customs. As per available information, the government has removed ‘Restricted Area Permit’ from 29 islands upto 2022, including islands which\xa0 are inhabited by PVTGs, 3 islands in South Andaman and 9 islands in Nicobar district. This has caused dismay and alarm amongst many who are concerned about the well being of the tribals. It obviously appears to be with an aim to mainstream the tribals, as also to boost tourism, albeit, without due diligence about the effects and in contravention of ANPATR-1956. It cannot be anyone’s case that Nicobar islands must remain restricted forever. But opening it should be a gradual process and with the consent of the tribal council. In fact in my tenure, we had started this dialogue with the tribal captains and there was a mixed response. It would be wise to move forward slowly and with sensitivity. Such decisions cannot be based on a notion to turn these islands into another Phuket or Macao. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",
